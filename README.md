# Library App Phase II
This assignment was part of my software development apprenticeship program. It is the second part of a multi-phase project in which I create a full-stack library application.

## Overview
Phase II of the library app has a front-end built with ReactJS, and utilizes a REST API to perform CRUD operations on books stored in a Cloud Firestore database on GCP.  This phase builds upon the first phase of the project, in which I used VanillaJS to build Classes through object-oriented programming.  In this phase, I refactored the VanillaJS version into a ReactJS implementation that manages state within components.  This phase did not require me to interact with the Firestore database directly, as the back-end was already built out. In addition, the HTML and CSS was provided to me as boiler plate code.
